## Instructions

1. To make a mark in the game, use the format `row:column` to mark a position on the board. For example, to mark the top-right cell, enter `1:3`.

2. The game will alternate between players, with 'X' and 'O' taking turns to make their moves.

3. The first player to align three of their symbols ('X' or 'O') either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
